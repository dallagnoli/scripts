# Linux Automation Roadmap

## Arch Install Script
- [X] Bypass firmware install if system is VM
- [ ] Swap NetworkManager for Systemd-Networkd
- [ ] Strip down packages and configuration for a very-minimal server install
- [ ] Add docker/container check

## Ideas
- [ ] Automate VM Creation (eg. quickly deploy an optimized Arch VM)
- [ ] Symlink repository to ~/bin and use fzf for navigation
